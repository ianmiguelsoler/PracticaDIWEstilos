				<h3>Keyboard instrument</h3>
				<p>The piano is a musical instrument played using a keyboard. </p>
				<p>It is widely used in classical and jazz music for solo performances, ensemble use, chamber music and accompaniment and for composing and rehearsal.</p>
				<p>Although the piano is not portable and often expensive, its versatility and ubiquity have made it one of the world's most familiar musical instruments.</p>

				<h3>History and musical performance</h3>
				<p>Much of classical music (e.g. that of Haydn, Mozart, Beethoven) was composed for a type of instrument (the fortepiano) that is rather different from the instrument on which it is now played.</p>
				<p>Even the music of the Romantic movement, including Liszt, Chopin, Robert Schumann, Felix Mendelssohn and Johannes Brahms, was written for pianos substantially different from modern pianos.</p>

				Notes<br />
				Encyclopædia Britannica (available online by subscription) also includes much information on the piano. In the 1988 edition, the primary article can be found in "Musical Instruments".<br />
				The Piano Book by Larry Fine gives the basics of how pianos work, and a thorough evaluative survey of current pianos and their manufacturers. It also includes advice on buying and owning pianos.
